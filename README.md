# FINAL PROJECT README 

Project Report - Final Project
 
When brainstorming where our group wanted to source datasets for our project, we looked at the Scikit-learn website for Machine Learning in Python. 
After converting with peers, we elected to go with the sklearn.datasets.load_boston as our dataset of choice. The data Boston house prices dataset contains 13 numeric/categorical predictive attributes. 
 
Including:

CRIM - per capita crime rate by town

ZN - the proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

INDUS - the proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM - the average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE - the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town

B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town

LSTAT - % lower status of the population

MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
 
The dataset was created by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L., and was taken from the StatLib library, which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. 
 
Given the sources disclosed when using the describe method, it can be assumed that this data originates from Boston housing-price data from 1978-1980. We will be using this Boston housing-price data for our machine learning project and will try and dive into linear regression problems.
